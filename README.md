# 👦What we do in this project
  This Project is centered around the daily return rate data of Moutai throughout the year. It focuses on the AutoRegressive (AR) model and the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, and introduces the Neural Network 
Estimator (NNE) to estimate the model parameters. Then, it studies the role of the NNE in estimating the parameters of the AR and ARIMA models.

# 📕About the file

**Data:**
  Considering that the data may involve some issues that have not been taken into account (such as security, copyright and so on), 
  if you need the data, please send me a private message or try to obtain it by yourself :D
  
**Train：**
  This file contains AR_NNE,ARIMA_NNE,ARIMA_TRA. The AR_NNE is that use NNE in AR model,the same with ARIMA_NNE. The ATIMA_Tra is that ues the Traditional parameter estimation methods

**Results:**
  Here are the results of our experiments.
